## **Hugging Face : Transformer Models**

The [**Transformer Models**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/HuggingFace/blob/main/01.%20Transformer%20Models/TransformerModels.ipynb) notebook is a comprehensive notebook as it contains a list of real world applications of **Transformers** such as **Sentiment Analysis**, **Zero-shot Classification**, **Text Generation**, **Mask Filling**, **Named Entity Recognition**, **Question Answering**, **Summarization**, and **Translation**.

**Natural Language Processing**
- NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.

**Transformer Pipelines**
- The three main steps involved when we pass some text to a **pipeline** are:
  - The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.
  - The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.
  - The predictions of the model are post-processed, so we can make sense of them.

**Zero-shot Classification**
- The zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful, as it allows us to specify which labels to use for the classification, so we don't have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. This pipeline is called zero-shot because we don't need to fine-tune the model on our data to use it. It can directly return probability scores for any list of labels we want.

**Text Generation**
- The main idea here is that when we provide a prompt and the model will auto-complete it by generating the remaining text.

**Mask Filling**
- The idea of this task is to fill in the blanks in a given text.

**Named Entity Recognition**
- NER is a task where the model has to find which parts of the input text correspond to entities such as persons, locations, or organizations.

**Question Answering**
- The question-answering pipeline answers questions using information from a given context.

**Summarization**
- Summarization is the task of reducing a text into a shorter text while keeping all or most of the important aspects referenced in the text.

**Translation**
